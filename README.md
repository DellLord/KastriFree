# KastriFree

Free version of the Kastri library

From Delphi Worlds: http://www.delphiworlds.com

Kastri:

* Is a cross-platform library which builds upon the existing RTL and FMX libraries in Delphi
* Supports a number of newer APIs that you won't find in FMX/RTL, and "backfills" for missing APIs
* Is structured in a way so as to avoid creating unnecessary dependencies
* Follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency and readability
* Is kept as simple as practicable

You'll find demo applications in the Demos folder, including those associated with articles posted on the Delphi Worlds blog:

These will be added to and updated over time as older articles are revisited
